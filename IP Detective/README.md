# IP Detective (IP_detective)

IP Detective is a bash script that allows you to quickly and efficiently check the location of an IP address using the ip-api.com service. It provides you with the city, region, and country information based on the given IP address.

## Prerequisites

Before using IP Detective, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

1. Bash: IP Detective is a bash script and requires bash to be installed on your system.
2. jq: IP Detective uses jq, a command-line JSON processor, to parse the API response. Ensure that jq is installed on your system. If not, you can download it from https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/.
3. Internet Connection: IP Detective relies on an internet connection to access the ip-api.com service and retrieve location information.

## Usage

To use IP Detective, simply run the script with the IP address as a command-line parameter. For example:

```bash
./IP_detective 15.45.0.1
```

Replace `15.45.0.1` with the desired IP address you want to investigate.

## Output

If the provided IP address is valid and the location information is successfully retrieved, IP Detective will display the following details:

```
City, Region in Country
```

For instance, the output might look like:

```
San Francisco, California in United States
```

In case the location information cannot be obtained (e.g., due to an invalid IP address or connection issues), the script will display:

```
IP location not found.
```
