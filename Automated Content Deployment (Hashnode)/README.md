## Introduction
The script is designed to automate the deployment of blog posts from a local repository to Hashnode, a platform for publishing and sharing blog articles. It utilizes a combination of environment setup, custom functions, and iterative processing to achieve this goal efficiently.

## Key Components
**Environment Setup:** Initial configuration involves defining critical paths and credentials necessary for the deployment process. These include the local repository path ($REPO_PATH), the Hashnode API endpoint ($HASHNODE_API), an authentication token ($API_KEY), and directories for posts and logs.

**Custom Function Definition:** The core functionality is encapsulated within the deploy_post function. This function accepts a single argument, representing the path to a Markdown (.md) file containing the blog post content. It then performs the following steps:
i. Reads the content of the file.
ii. Constructs a HTTP POST request to the Hashnode API, including necessary headers for authorization and content type.
iii. Sends the request and appends the response (including any errors) to a log file for record-keeping.
iv. Outputs a confirmation message upon successful deployment.

**Iterative Processing**: The script navigates to the specified repository directory and iterates over each Markdown file located within the designated posts directory. For each file, it invokes the deploy_post function to handle the deployment process.
Completion Logging: Upon completion of the deployment process for all identified posts, the script records the timestamp of completion in the log file, providing a clear audit trail of the operation.

## Deployment Process Flow
**Initialization**: The script begins by setting up essential configurations required for the deployment process.
**Deployment Loop:** It then enters a loop, iterating over each Markdown file in the specified directory. For each iteration, it calls the deploy_post function, passing the current file as an argument.
**Logging and Confirmation:** Throughout the process, all operations, including successes and errors, are logged to a designated file. Upon completion, a final log entry is made, indicating the successful completion of the deployment process.
