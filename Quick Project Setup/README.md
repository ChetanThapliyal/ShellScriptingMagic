# Quick Project Setup Script

This repository contains a simple yet intutive script, `project_setup.sh`, designed to streamline the process of setting up a new project quickly. The script automates various tasks involved in the initial project setup, making it easier for developers to get started with their projects without repetitive manual steps.

## Script Contents

The `project_setup.sh` script performs the following steps:

1. **Create Project Directory**: The script creates a new project directory named `my_project`. This will be the root directory for your project.

2. **Initialize Git Repository**: Inside the newly created `my_project` directory, a Git repository is initialized using `git init`. This enables version control for your project.

3. **Create Necessary Directories**: The script creates essential directories for your project, such as `src` (for source code files), `docs` (for documentation), and `tests` (for test files).

4. **Create Initial Files**: Two initial files are generated in the project directory: `README.md`, which serves as the primary documentation for your project, and `src/main.py`, a sample source code file. If you're using a different programming language, feel free to replace `src/main.py` with a file of your preferred language.

5. **Install Required Dependencies**: The script includes an example command to install Python dependencies using `pip install`. If you're not using Python or prefer to manage dependencies differently, modify this part of the script according to your language's package manager or project requirements.

6. **Initialize Virtual Environment**: A virtual environment is created for your Python project using Python's `venv` module. If you're not using Python or prefer a different approach for managing project dependencies and environments, you can omit this section or replace it with your language's equivalent tools.

7. **Additional Setup Steps**: This section is intentionally left blank for you to add any custom setup steps specific to your project. For example, you may set environment variables, configure database connections, or perform other project-specific configurations.
